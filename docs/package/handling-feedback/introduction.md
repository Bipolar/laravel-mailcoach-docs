When you've sent out a campaign mail sending services will provide feedback. They will let you know open, clicks, bounces and complaints on each mail sent. 

Open and click data will be used to calculate the open and click ratio of a campaign. Bounces and complaints feedback will be used to keep your email list healthy by unsubscribing the bounced email address.

Mailcoach can handle this feedback using add on packages.
