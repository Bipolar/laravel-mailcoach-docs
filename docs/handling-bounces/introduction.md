Some of the mails you sent might bounce. Even on lists where you use double opt in this might happen. For example when subscribers used their work e-mail address to subscribe and change work, the e-mail address that was valid, isn't valid anymore.

Most mail sending services provide feedback on bounced mails. We provide several add on package to process that feedback. To keep your email list healthy, any e-mail address that was reported as bounced will be unsubscribed from your list.
