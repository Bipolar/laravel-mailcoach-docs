Mailcoach can't send out emails by itself. To do this, Mailcoach needs a mail configuration with a third party email delivery platform. We currently provide support for some of the biggest players in the market, and we will guide you through the setup with all of them:

- [Amazon SES setup](todo:link)

- [SendGrid setup](todo:link)

- [Mailgun setup](todo:link)

- [SMTP setup](todo:link)

## Sending test mails

To make sure Mailcoach is happy with your mail configuration, send a test mail to your own email address. It should arrive in your mailbox not long after, and should look a bit like this:
