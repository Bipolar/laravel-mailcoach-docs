An email campaign is a set of emails that can be sent to an email list (or part of it).

The campaigns index page summarizes some information about your campaigns. You can see the status of the campaign (editing, scheduled, sending or sent), the amount of people it was sent to, the amount of times it was opened and links were clicked, and when it was sent or last modified. The percentage below the opens and clicks are as part of the total amount of subscribers that received your email. You can use the action menu to the right of a campaign to duplicate it and start configuring a new campaign.
