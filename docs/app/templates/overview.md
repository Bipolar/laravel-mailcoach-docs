You can preview what this template will look like in a user's email client by creating a campaign based on this template, and visiting the campaign's _Content_ tab.

You can use placeholders for certain Mailcoach actions in your links:

- `::unsubscribeUrl::` The URL where users can unsubscribe
- `::webViewUrl::` This URL will display the HTML of the campaign
- `::subscriber.first_name::` The first name of the subscriber
