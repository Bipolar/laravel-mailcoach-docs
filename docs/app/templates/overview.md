Templates provide a starting point for a campaign's email content.

## Creating a template

// TODO // Screenshot of template detail screen

You can preview what this template will look like in a user's email client by creating a campaign based on this template, and visiting the campaign's _Content_ tab.

You can use placeholders for certain Mailcoach actions in your links:

- `::unsubscribeUrl::` The url where users can unsubscribe
- `::webViewUrl::` This url will display the html of the campaign
- `::subscriber.first_name::` The first name of the subscriber
