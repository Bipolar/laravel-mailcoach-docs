Welcome to the Mailcoach app documentation! These pages are here to guide you through your setup and management of your Mailcoach dashboard.

There are three ways of installing Mailcoach.

1. If you already have a Laravel application, you can install Mailcoach as a package inside it. Head over to the [package installation instructions](/docs/package/general/installation-and-setup) to continue.

2. If you have no experience with Laravel or PHP, the easiest way to get started is our 1-click-installer. This installer will provision a new server at Digital Ocean, install Mailcoach and all it's dependencies on it.

3. If you have experience with Laravel and PHP, and want to use Mailcoach as a standalone application, you can [use composer to create a new Laravel project with Mailcoach preinstalled](https://mailcoach.app.test/docs/app/installation/using-composer).

- Make sure you have a valid license key when using Mailcoach. 

- You should make sure you have a valid [mail configuration](/docs/app/mail-configuration/introduction)

- If your colleagues should also be able to create campaigns and view their stats, create a user for them to use in the dashboard by going over to the _Users_ page:
