---

Welcome to the Mailcoach app documentation! These pages are here to guide you through your setup and management of your Mailcoach dashboard. Here are some useful things to get started:

- Make sure you have a valid license key when using Mailcoach. You need to buy a license key for each domain. Keys stay valid for one year, during which you get all the updates we make to Mailcoach.

- You should make sure you have a valid [mail configuration](https://mailcoach.app/docs/app/mail-configuration/introduction)

- If your colleagues should also be able to create campaigns and view their stats, create a user for them to use in the dashboard by going over to the _Users_ page:
